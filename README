Story:
======

Four friends, stuck in a hotel room one evening, with rain pouring down outside, a plane flight leaving early the next morning, and nothing to do in the mean time, found themselves with two chessboards.

“Aha!” they thought, “we’ll play [[bughouse]]!”

Unfortunately, bughouse requires chess clocks, and they had none.

“Aha!” they thought, “we’ll make our own chess clocks, using only our laptops and our wits!”

And so, in the next few minutes, they coded up a couple of JavaScript/HTML chess clocks… and proceeded to spend the night on a few dozen epic bughouse games.

A bit of polishing later, one of them looks like this.


Instructions:
=============

To use the chess clock:
